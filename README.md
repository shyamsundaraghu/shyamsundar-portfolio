## üåü About This Project

This portfolio is more than just a resume; it's an interactive experience built to highlight my core competencies in antenna design, wireless sensor networks, and bio-inspired computing. The goal was to create a clean, modern, and easily navigable platform where visitors can explore my projects, publications, and technical skills in detail.

The design philosophy is centered around a dark, minimalist aesthetic with a vibrant blue accent color to draw attention to key elements. Smooth animations and a logical content flow are used to create an engaging user experience.
